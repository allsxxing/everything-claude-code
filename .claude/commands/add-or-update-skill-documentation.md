# /add-or-update-skill-documentation

Use this workflow when working on **add-or-update-skill-documentation** in `everything-claude-code`.

## Goal

Adds a new skill or updates documentation for an existing skill, typically in the form of a SKILL.md file under skills/ or skills/*/SKILL.md.

## Common Files

- `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Create or update skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
- Optionally update AGENTS.md or README.md to reflect new skill
- Optionally add architecture diagrams or implementation notes

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
